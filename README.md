Utilizing React to make a responsive COVID-tracker. I used an API to display different things, such as infected, recovery and deaths. You can also see the different countries datas as well as full global stats! I used Material-UI to utilize the card components to display the different numbers for each setting. I also used Javascript-chart-2 to display the data in a more pleasing way! Feel free to check out the code!
